§bCrafting Grid (3x3)

§7Below is the exact layout for the crafting grid to create a basic energy block:

@matrix_craft:minecraft:furnace, minecraft:cobblestone, minecraft:cobblestone, minecraft:cobblestone, minecraft:cobblestone, minecraft:redstone, minecraft:cobblestone, minecraft:cobblestone, minecraft:cobblestone, minecraft:cobblestone,center

§bCrafting Grid Alignment

§7Like images, the crafting grid can be aligned horizontally. To do this, add the alignment parameter to the end of the directive:

§7§lCentered:
§6`@matrix_craft:result, slot1, ..., slot9, center`

§7§lLeft Aligned:
§6`@matrix_craft:result, slot1, ..., slot9, left`

§7§lRight Aligned:
§6`@matrix_craft:result, slot1, ..., slot9, right`

§7The alignment parameter must always be specified **§6last§7**, separated by a comma after all 9 crafting slots.
